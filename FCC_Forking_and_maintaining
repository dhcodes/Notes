Rebasing from Upstream
Do this every time prior to creating a branch for a PR:

Make sure you are in the staging branch
bash
$ git status
On branch staging
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/staging'.

If you are not on staging, resolve any outstanding files/commits and checkout staging
git checkout staging
Do a pull with rebase against upstream:
git pull --rebase upstream staging

This will pull down all of the changes on the official staging without making an additional commit in your local repo.
4. (Optional) Force push your updated staging to your GitHub fork

git push origin staging --force

This will overwrite the staging branch on your fork.

bash
$ git push origin staging --force
